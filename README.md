# Depression Detection using Images, Speech, and Text

This project uses deep learning techniques to detect depression from *images, **speech, and **text* data. It combines multiple data sources to improve accuracy and give better insights for mental health analysis.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze emotional and behavioral signals through:
- 🖼 Facial expressions (Image)
- 🎙 Voice tone & patterns (Speech)
- ✍ Written or spoken words (Text)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- OpenCV, librosa, NLTK / spaCy
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📁 Structure

- data/ – Datasets (images, audio, text)
- notebooks/ – Jupyter Notebooks for each data type
- models/ – Trained models
- scripts/ – Python files for training, testing, etc.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BHEEREDDYAKANKSHA/depression-detection-with-images-speech-and-text-using-deep-learning-algorithm.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
bash
cd depression-detection-with-images-speech-and-t
3. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks to start exploring:
jupyter notebook
5. Run notebooks inside the notebooks/ folder:
image_analysis.ipynb – For facial expression detection
speech_analysis.ipynb – For voice tone and audio feature analysis
text_analysis.ipynb – For sentiment/NLP-based text classification
This project is part of my journey in learning data analytics and applying deep learning to real-world mental health problems. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
